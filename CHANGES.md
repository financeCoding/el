* Sep. 20, 2012: alpha version
 * Porting EL 2.2 from Java implementation of Tomcat 7 to Dart language(in brutal way :-)).
 * Some Java specific functions are removed(e.g. There is no BigDecimal in Dart; thus not in Rikulo-el, either).
 * It uses Dart Mirror a lot.
 * EL parser seems working great.
 * There must be rooms for extra features in Dart specifically(e.g. named optional arguments for function).
